Utilities for performing data analysis on listed options.

I wrote this to solve my first problem in attempting to do any sort of analysis on listed options - getting the data. The collection of python routines here takes snap shots of live or settlement data via a bloomberg connection (for which you obviously need a licence) and imports them into a <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> panel which you can use and abuse as you see fit.
