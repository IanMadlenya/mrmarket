# right. any half-baked charts dreampt up during the day to go here



# 1) Curve bar chart.
# Given a panel with ohlc fields, plot each instrument as a bar chart with OHLC represented somehow. Idea is you 
# get a representation of where it is now and where it's been in the past.

# FX Movers
# Barchart of moves since a given date (sorted by move, or by other interesting criteria)
# 2d charts of moves in spot-vol, spot-carry, vol-carry, 
# again 2d charts of moves since-given date vs current a/c, or carry.
